## Bio
I enjoy the process of learning and building things. I am currently learning Next.js in order to build fast websites & web applications.

I have a BA in Computer Science from OC. My final project in school was to work with a team to develop social-media-like application for a real client. Since graduating I have been trying to stay sharp by solving problems on leetcode and learning new technologies by build projects.

I like to find new music, watch critically acclaimed dramas, and I am currently learning how to cook in my free time.
